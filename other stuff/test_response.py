The individual is holding a white cane with a red end, suggesting that they may be visually impaired. They are also holding a smartphone in their other hand and appear to be interacting with it. The person is dressed in a light pink jacket, dark blue jeans, and is carrying a shoulder bag with a floral pattern.
